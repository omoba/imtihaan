                <h2>The Cost of Cheating</h2>
                <p>It was a bright Tuesday morning at Al-Noor Elementary School. The classroom buzzed with excitement as Teacher Fatima announced, "Tomorrow, we'll have a math competition. The top student will get a special prize!"</p>
                
                <p>Amir's eyes widened. "A prize? I want to win, InshaAllah!" he whispered to his friend Hasan.</p>
                
                <p>That evening, at home, Amir sat at his desk with his math notebook open. The questions were tricky. "Hmm," he muttered. "If I could just look at Hasan's answers tomorrow, no one would know."</p>
                
                <p>Amirah, his twin sister, overheard him. "Amir! That's cheating," she said firmly. "You can't do that."<br>Amir shrugged. "It's just once. It won't hurt anyone."<br>Amirah frowned. "But it will displease Allah."<br>Amir rolled his eyes. "Nothing bad will happen. You'll see."</p>
                
                <p>The next day, during the competition, Amir peeked at Hasan's paper and copied a few answers. When Teacher Fatima announced the results, Amir had the highest score. Everyone clapped.</p>
                
                <p>"Alhamdulillah!" Amir shouted proudly. He whispered to Amirah, "See? No one got hurt."<br>Amirah sighed. "Just because nothing bad happened doesn't make it right."</p>
                
                <p>That evening, Baba overheard them. "Amir," he said gently, "Do you know what the Prophet ﷺ said about cheating?"<br>Amir looked up. Baba recited:</p>
                
                <p>"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ passed by a man who was selling food. He put his hand in it and saw that there was something wrong with it. The Prophet ﷺ said, 'He is not one of us who cheats.'" (Sahih Muslim)</p>
                
                <p>Baba continued, "Cheating means hiding the truth. Even if no one sees it, Allah does. And when we cheat, we lose His blessings."<br>Amir felt a little uneasy but didn't say anything.</p>
                
                <p>Days passed. Amir began to cheat in small ways—copying homework answers, taking shortcuts during chores, and pretending to finish his prayers quickly. Each time, nothing bad seemed to happen.</p>
                
                <p>One afternoon, during science class, Amir whispered to Hasan, "Let me copy your experiment notes. We'll finish faster." Hasan hesitated but agreed. They both got good grades again.</p>
                
                <p>Amir smirked. "See? Cheating helps sometimes."</p>
                
                <p>Amirah shook her head. "Maybe now, but one day, you'll regret it, Amir."</p>
                             
                <p>The following week, Teacher Fatima announced a new group project. Amir was excited. "I'll lead our group!" he said. But instead of researching properly, he copied an entire report from a website and added his name to it.</p>
                
                <p>On presentation day, the teacher listened quietly. When Amir finished, she said calmly, "Amir, can you explain how this experiment works?"</p>
                
                <p>Amir froze. He didn't understand what he had copied. His classmates stared. Hasan whispered, "Oh no…"</p>
                
                <p>Teacher Fatima sighed. "Amir, I checked. This report was copied from the internet. You cheated."</p>
                
                <p>Amir's face turned red. "I'm sorry," he said softly.</p>
                
                <p>After class, Baba was called in. Amir admitted everything, tears rolling down his cheeks. "I thought it didn't hurt anyone," he sobbed. "But now I feel ashamed."</p>
                
                <p>Baba hugged him. "My son, Allah gives us many chances to do right. The worst part of cheating isn't getting caught—it's losing Allah's pleasure."</p>
                
                <p>Amir nodded, wiping his tears. "I'll never cheat again, InshaAllah. I want Allah to be pleased with me."</p>
           
                <p>From that day, Amir worked honestly, even when it was hard. He began to feel peaceful knowing Allah was pleased with his efforts.</p>
                
                <p>Whenever he saw someone tempted to cheat, he would remind them, "The Prophet ﷺ said, 'He is not one of us who cheats.'"</p>
                
                <p>And he meant it with all his heart.</p>
